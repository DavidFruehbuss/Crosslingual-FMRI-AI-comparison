# Crosslingual-FMRI-AI-comparison

Comparing the representations of human FMRI recordings and large language model's layer activations in large language models across three languages. This repositiory contains the code and additional material for our submission.

## Structure

The code base is structured as follows:

- `[Analysis.ipynb](Analysis.ipynb)`: contains the main analyis
- `[AI_pipeline.job](AI_pipeline.job)`: contains the preprocessing pipeline for the language model data, and RSA computations
  - the remaining python scripts contain helper functions for the pipeline

### Additional Data

- The poster can be found in [here](poster.pdf).
